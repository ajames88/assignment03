The executable to run this program is titled "run". Enter the following command
into the terminal to run the program: './run'

This program uses a vector space model to perform document clustering based on
the cosine similarity of tfidf values.

The documents being clustered appear in the folder 'dataSet'. Users may add or
remove documents from this folder to suit their needs. The current data set is
a set of essays from Freshman at the University of South Carolina from an
English 101 course.

The output of this program will appear in the document 'output.txt'. This
document is overwritten each time the program is ran. The output appears in
the following form:

Dimensions in frequency vector space: <value>

<document>
TFIDF Relations: <value>
Cluster: <set of documents in the cluster>
similar Words: <set of similar words between documents that define the cluster>

(Repeat the data above for each document)

Average relations per Document: <value>
